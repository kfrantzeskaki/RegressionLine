How It Works: 

âœ” It defines two NumPy arrays: Hours_of_studying(study hours) , grades (corresponding grades). 

âœ” Uses NumPy's polyfit function to calculate the slope and intercept of the best-fit line. 

âœ” Computes the regression line equation:  

                              y=slopeÃ—x+intercept 

 
âœ” Prints the calculated slope and intercept values. 

âœ” Uses Matplotlib to: Plot the data points (scatter plot in blue), Plot the regression line (in red).  

âœ” Label axes and add a legend for clarity. 

This visualization helps understand how study hours affect grades using a linear trend. ðŸš€
